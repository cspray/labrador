<p class="content">
  An opinionated microframework written on top of <a href="https://amphp.org">Amp</a> with the goals of helping to create
  well-tested, cleanly-separated asynchronous PHP applications and reusable components we call "Plugins". If you're new to
  Labrador Kennel we recommend you start off with the tutorial <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/quick-start">Quick Start</a>
  and continuing down the list of tutorials in order.

  <div class="message-body">
    We expect you to have a solid understanding of how to write asynchronous PHP, particularly with Amp. If you are not
    familiar with async PHP we <em>highly recommend</em> you checkout the <a href="https://amphp.org/amp/">Amp Documentation</a>
    before continuing.
