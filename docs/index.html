      <p class="content">
        The documentation for Labrador Kennel Core so that you can become familiar with working on developing for the
        internal packages or creating your own applications on top of Labrador Kennel. This package contains all of the
        "low-level" concepts including Plugins, Applications, and Engines.
      </p>

      <h3 class="is-size-3">Async by design</h3>

      <p class="content">
        It is important to remember that all Labrador Kennel packages are asynchronous by design unless explicitly noted
        in the package documentation. Asynchronous applications require a different way of thinking if you've only ever
        developed synchronous PHP applications. It is highly recommended that you take a look through, and understand,
        <a href="https://amphp.org/amp/">Amp</a> before continuing with the rest of this documentation. The rest of this
        guide assumes that you understand how Promises work and how to resolve Promises on the Event Loop.
      </p>

      <h3 class="is-size-3">Embrace Dependency Injection</h3>

      <p class="content">
        Labrador uses <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/130862">Dependency Injection</a> throughout its codebase and
        encourages your application to do the same. The complexities behind providing and sharing dependencies is taken
        care of by the <a href="https://github.com/rdlowrey/auryn">Auryn IoC container</a>. Auryn does not work like
        other PHP containers. You should understand the power it provides and how to wire an object graph with it before
        developing on internal packages or creating applications on top of Labrador Kennel.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        You should severely restrict the amount of code that requires the Auryn container to be injected into it. You
        effectively make your container a <a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorisanAnti-Pattern/">Service Locator</a>
        which highly detracts from the value of Dependency Injection. Generally speaking there are very few times where
        you should be required to pass an Injector to a constructor, object factories would be a notable exception. For
        example, the `PluginManager` requires an Inject be passed in the constructor to satisfy the requirements of the
        `InjectorAwarePlugin`. However, the Injector is explicitly defined as a PluginManager constructor dependency and
        is not simply shared with itself.
